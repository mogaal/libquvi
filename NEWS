1. Notes
--------

Developers:
* Read these changes carefully, especially "4. API changes"

Packagers/downstream maintainers/whatnot:
* Read (at least) the "5. Distribution changes"


2. Introducing Lua
------------------

Introduce Lua <http://lua.org> scripts to the project. Video link parsing
was completely reworked. All of the parsing is now done in website specific
Lua scripts. This has some advantages to the old design:

  * No need to tweak the library GNU Autotools files or C source code
  * Scripts can be edited, dropped in, removed and reloaded
  * Less likely to introduce memory leaks
  * Lua language and syntax


3. Format ID changes
--------------------

Common:
* "flv" -> "default", not all websites default to "flv" (Adobe flash video)

Youtube:
* Reworked the format ID array

Google (Video):
* Removed "mp4" format ID

Spiegel:
* Reworked the format ID array
* New default (vp6_64 -> vp_388)


4. API changes
--------------

Changes:
* Added additional QUVIcodes for Lua
* Added quvi_free
* Added quvi_next_supported_website
  - Deprecates quvi_next_host (see below)

Deprecated:

5. Distribution changes
-----------------------

Changes:
* Additional dependency for Lua 5.1 (library)
* Additional files installed from doc/ and share/
  - See doc/Makefile.am and share/Makefile.am for a complete list
* Options for configure:
  - --with-doc (default:yes)
  - --enable-examples (default:no)
