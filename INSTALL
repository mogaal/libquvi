    Installation

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".

    --enable-tests          Enable tests (e.g. "make check")
    --enable-verbose-tests  Verbose tests
    --enable-nsfw           Install (&test) website scripts marked as "NSFW"
    --enable-todo           Install (&test) w. scripts marked as "TODO" [1]
    --enable-nlfy           Test website scripts marked as "NLFY" [2]
    --disable-quvi          Do not build (/install) quvi(1) command
    --disable-examples      Do not build examples
    --without-man           Do not install manual pages
    --without-doc           Do not install doc/ contents

[1] These may be broken scripts that need fixing, not recommended unless
    you are a developer/contributor

[2] These may be scripts for websites that are known to block IPs from
    outside of their "world of view"; note that this switch affects
    the tests only -- these scripts are installed nonetheless


    C API documentation

"make dox" generates the C API reference documentation from the doxygen
tags. Both, HTML and LaTeX, documentation are generated by default. These
are also made available at: <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>


    Tests

e.g. "make check", the following environment variables can be used:

  NO_INTERNET         Disable all tests that require internet connection
  TEST_RESTRICTED     Enable website rule tests known for country restrictions
  QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS   Additional options to pass to quvi when the tests are run

Note that only the HTTP tests are run.

Examples:
    QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS="--debug -n" make check     # See --enable-tests
