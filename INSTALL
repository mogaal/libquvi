    Installation

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".

For example:
    --enable-smut   Enable adult website support
    --enable-broken Enable broken website support
    --disable-quvi  Disable building and installation of the quvi program
    --without-man   Do not install the manual pages

Please note that --enable-broken is recommended to be used only
if you are looking into helping to fix a broken website support.

"make dox" generates the C API reference documentation from the doxygen
tags. Both, HTML and LaTeX, documentation are generated by default.


    Tests

e.g. "make check", the following environment variables can be used:

  NO_INTERNET         Disable all tests that require internet connection
  TEST_RESTRICTED     Enable tests on hosts that may have country restrictions
  QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS   Additional options to pass to quvi when the tests are run

Examples:
    QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS="--debug -n" ./make check
    NO_INTERNET=1 ./make distcheck
