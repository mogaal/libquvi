Installation from source
------------------------

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
If you are compiling quvi from the development code from the git
repository, see "Installation from development code", instead.

    --enable-tests          Enable tests (e.g. "make check", req. Perl)
                                The tests are not run by default. For
                                verbose tests, set TEST_VERBOSE
                                environment.

    --enable-nsfw           Install (&test) webscripts marked as "NSFW"
                                "Not safe for work" webscripts. Not installed
                                by default.

    --enable-todo           Install (&test) webscripts marked as "TODO"
                                Broken, outdated etc. webscripts. Not
                                installed by default. Recommended for
                                developers only.

    --enable-nlfy           Enable *tests* for webscripts marked as "NLFY"
                                "No love for you" scripts for websites that
                                follow strict country policies (a.k.a.
                                "Sorry, we do not accept connections from
                                your country"). Not tested by default.
                                See also --enable-tests above. These
                                webscripts are installed *always*.

    --disable-quvi          Do not build (&install) the quvi command
    --enable-examples       Build examples which are not compiled by default

    --with-soup             Build with libsoup(-gnome)
                                Required *only* by examples/callback_libsoup.c,
                                ignored unless both --enable-examples and
                                --with-soup are used

    --without-manual        Do not install manual page(s).


Installation from development code
----------------------------------

If you are compiling quvi from the development code, run "autogen.sh",
first. This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake
  * GNU gengetopt

Once the files have been generated, follow the instructions in "Installation
from source" above.


C API documentation
-------------------

"make doc" generates the C API reference documentation from the
NaturalDocs tags. The same documentation is available at:
    <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>

The documentation is not installed with quvi.


Tests
-----

"configure --enable-tests && make check", typically. The test suite is
intended for developers only and will use the Internet. See also
$top_srcdir/tests/README.
