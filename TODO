--------------------------

The support for the websites that have been marked as "broken"
is disabled by default. Compile quvi with the --enable-broken
to re-enable them.

* ehrensenf.de, broken as of 0.1.2, see lib/host/ehrensenf.c
  - the server returns http/404 for the compiled video links
  - any info/data/patches appreciated
    - e.g. flash generated tcp traffic logs that we could backtrace

* spyfilms.com, broken as of 0.1.2, see lib/host/spyfilms.c
  - website changes, new design relies even more heavily on flash+js
    - previously visible variable values in html have been hidden in flash
  - any info/data/patches appreciated
    - e.g. flash generated tcp traffic logs that we could backtrace
