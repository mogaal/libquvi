License

libquvi is free software, licensed under the LGPLv2.1+. The lua scripts
that libquvi uses are considered as programs and using the lua scripts
is *linking*.


Motivation
==========

libquvi originates from the idea of allowing users to view the videos
without having to install or use flash. It is a "workaround", not an
"alternative" to flash.
