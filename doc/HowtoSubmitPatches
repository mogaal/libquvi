Howto: Submit patches
=====================

If you are using git:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

If you are working with diff, then at very least, use "diff -u" when you
generate the patch.

The preferred way to do this is to submit your patch to the patch tracker at:
  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=354489>

Otherwise, email it directly to the author (<legatvs at sign gmail com>).

Thanks!
