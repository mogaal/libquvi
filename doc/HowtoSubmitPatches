Howto: Submit patches
=====================

If you are using git:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

If you are working with diff use "diff -u" at very least when you generate
your patches.

Submit to either <http://code.google.com/p/quvi/issues/> issue tracker,
or <legatvs@gmail.com>. If you need to discuss the changes,
email (above) the patch instead.

Thanks!
