Howto: Submit patches
=====================

If you are using git:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

If you are working with diff, then at very least, use "diff -u" when you
generate the patch.

You can submit your patch to the issue tracker:
  <http://code.google.com/p/quvi/issues/>

Or directly to the author (<legatvs gmail com>). The former is the
preferred method.

Thanks!
