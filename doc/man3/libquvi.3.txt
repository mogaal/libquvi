NAME
----
libquvi - Overview of the library

DESCRIPTION
-----------
libquvi is a cross-platform library with C API for parsing adobe
flash media properties. "quvi" is an acronym for "query video".

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

LIBQUVI_EXCLUSIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR::
  When defined, the library will *only* use those scripts found at the
  directories specified by the LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR.
+
NOTE: Useful, for example, when the current set of the scripts at
      $top_srcdir/share/ (of libquvi-scripts) are being tested by the
      testsuite of the libquvi-scripts.  The library would, otherwise,
      include the scripts from the libquvi-scripts instance built with
      the library and likely interfere with the tests.

LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR::
  The library will additionally look in the colon-separated list of
  directories specified by the LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR environment variable.

LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_VERBOSE::
  When defined, enables the output from any libquvi scripts using the
  debug facility ('quvi/debug' module).

LIBQUVI_SHOW_DIR::
  When defined, the library will output the paths of the searched
  directories to the stderr.

LIBQUVI_SHOW_SCRIPT::
  When defined, the library will output the file names of the found
  scripts to stderr. The output will also indicate whether the script
  was accepted by the library.

Proxy::
  libquvi uses linkman:libcurl[3]. See the libcurl documentation (C API
  and/or linkman:curl[1]) for a complete list of the supported proxy
  environment variables.
