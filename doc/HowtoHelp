Howto: Help with the project
============================

1. Notes
--------

quvi is developed on Linux (i686) and sometimes tested under
FreeBSD (i386). It is impossible for us to detect and fix errors on
all different system configurations without help.

If you are a downstream maintainer, and you think the upstream could
benefit from your patches, please consider submitting them to the
upstream. See $prefix/share/doc/quvi/HowtoSubmitPatches for contact
details.


2. What you can do
------------------

* Report bugs (http://quvi.googlecode.com/)
  - Check for duplicates before you submit
  - We may have addressed/closed the issue already

* Write fixes
  - Check the issue tracker for open issues
  - Write fixes for yet unreported issues
  - See also $prefix/share/doc/quvi/HowtoSubmitPatches

* Write support for an additional website
  - See $prefix/share/doc/quvi/HowtoContributeCode

* Gather and report website specific data
  - You make a good candidate if you can execute Adobe Flash object code (e.g. player)
  - TCP traffic, etc. (there are a number of tools to do this these days)
  - See $prefix/share/doc/quvi/HowtoContributeCode, which discusses this briefly
