License:

quvi and libquvi are free software, licensed under the <LGPLv2.1+ at
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>. The LUA
scripts that quvi uses are considered as programs and using the LUA scripts
is *linking*.


Motivation:

quvi parses Adobe Flash media stream URLs for third party applications. It
originates from the idea of allowing users to view the videos without having
to install or use Adobe Flash Player. quvi is not an "alternative" but rather
a "workaround" to Adobe Flash Player.

Background:

quvi was inspired by cclive. Embeddable LUA scripting was introduced in the
0.2.0 release.
