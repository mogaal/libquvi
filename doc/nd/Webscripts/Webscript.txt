Title: Webscript

About: About

libquvi runs "webscripts" (or "website scripts") to parse the media
details. These details are then returned to the applications using
libquvi. The scripts are written in <lua at http://www.lua.org/about.html>.
There is a corresponding script for each supported website, although some
exceptions to this rule exist.
