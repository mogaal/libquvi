Title: Help: Patches

About: Before you submit patches

Checklist.

License:

You agree to put your changes and new code under the same license
quvi, libquvi and libquvi-scripts are using already unless stated
and agreed otherwise.

Webscripts:

If you are submitting a new website script, please include a test
JSON file with it.

(start code)
quvi -q $TEST_URL > foo.json
(end)

Please set the "url" field to *empty* ("") in the JSON. The test
suite ignores this value because many websites generate unique URLs
rather than use static ones. Omitting these URLs from the test data,
helps keep the test suite uncluttered.

Style:

About: Creating a patch

Whenever possible, please submit your contributions in the <patch at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28Unix%29> format.

If you create your patches with <git at http://git-scm.com/>

  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch
  * Or send a pull request to the mailing list (see <Help>)

If you use diff(1) instead, make sure you use the "-u" switch.


About: Where to submit

See <Help> for the mailing list.
