Howto: Help with the project
============================

About
-----

libquvi is developed under Linux (x86) and occasionally tested under
FreeBSD (x86). It is impossible for us to detect and fix errors on
all different system configurations without help. Therefore feedback
and help is greatly appreciated.

If you are a downstream maintainer, and you think the upstream and
others could benefit from your patches, please consider submitting
them to the upstream.

* Report bugs (http://quvi.googlecode.com/)
  - Check for duplicates before you submit

* Write fixes
  - Check the issue tracker for open issues
  - Write fixes for yet unreported issues

* Write support for additional websites
  - See HowtoAddSupport

* Gather and report website specific data
  - You make a good candidate if you can run Adobe flash player
  - TCP traffic, etc. (there are a number of tools to do this these days)
  - This data could be used to figure out how the videos can be extracted
  - See http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=6#c7 (for an example)
