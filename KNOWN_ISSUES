UNDECLARED ERRORS
=================

EXAMPLE

Upgrading to 0.2.8

% make
...
lib/quvi.c:225:10: error: 'QUVIOPT_NOSHORTENED' undeclared (first use in this function)
...

CONFIRMED

  * Arch Linux cross-compiling with mingw32

CAUSE

AM_ICONV adds `-I' option to CPPFLAGS. If that path contains an old quvi/quvi.h
file, you will see the above error when you run `make'.

From <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Catalogue-of-Rules>:

  Compiling C programs
    n.o is made automatically from n.c with a recipe of the
    form ‘$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c’.

POSSIBLE WORKAROUNDS

  * Uninstall the old version of quvi (recommended)

  Or:

  * Edit manually the CPPFLAGS in

    Makefile
    lib/Makefile
    src/Makefile
    removing the -I$dir

        This may, however, mess up the libiconv integration with quvi.

REFERENCES

  * <http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/AM_005fICONV.html>
    "... it adds an ‘-I’ option to CPPFLAGS if necessary."

NOTES

We'd prefer to fix this at the upstream if we knew how to. The CPPFLAGS cannot
obviously be overlooked either, otherwise libiconv integration will result in
errors on some configurations.
