* Dailymotion ("make check") expected file length fails randomly

    error: file length:
      expected: "3539445"
      got: "3538963"

      -> child: normal termination (1)
    FAIL: support-dailymotion.pl

  No idea what's causing the difference. No point switching the values
  either, since this random. Ignore for now.
